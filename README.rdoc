== script.aculo.us web 2.0 javascript

The Web is changing. The 30-year-old terminal-like technology it was originally 
is gradually giving way to new ways of doing things. The power of AJAX allows 
for rich user interaction without the trouble that has bugged traditional 
web applications. 

Building upon the wonderful Prototype JavaScript library, script.aculo.us 
provides you with some great additional ingredients to mix in.

== What's new in this release?

See the CHANGELOG file for information on what's new.

You can follow http://twitter.com/scriptaculous if you want
to be updated as we fix bugs and add new features.

== Installation/Usage

script.aculo.us includes the Prototype JavaScript Framework 
V1.6.0. You can use later versions, as they become available 
(see http://prototypejs.org/).

Put prototype.js, and the six files scriptaculous.js, 
builder.js, effects.js, dragdrop.js, controls.js and slider.js 
in a directory of your website, e.g. /javascripts.

(The sound.js and unittest.js files are optional)

Now, you can include the scripts by adding the following 
tags to the HEAD section of your HTML pages:

 <script src="/javascripts/prototype.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
 <script src="/javascripts/scriptaculous.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

scriptaculous.js will automatically load the other files of the 
script.aculo.us distribution in, provided they are accessible 
via the same path.

See http://madrobby.github.io/scriptaculous/ for detailed
usage instructions.

== The distribution

Besides the script.aculo.us files in src, there's a complete
test tree included which holds functional and unit tests for
script.aculo.us.

If you need examples on how to implement things, the best place to
start is by opening test/run_functional_tests.html or 
test/run_unit_tests.html in your browser, and looking at
the sources of the examples provided.
